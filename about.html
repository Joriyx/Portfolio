      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm JÃ¸rgine, a creative and curious person who loves
        exploring the world of app development, photography, and gaming. I have
        a knack for combining technical skills with imagination to bring ideas
        to life, whether that's designing a new app, snapping a perfect photo,
        or figuring out how to level up in my favorite game.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not diving into code or testing new app ideas, you'll probably
        find me behind a camera lens capturing moments that tell stories, or
        (let's be honest) annoying my brother just for fun, it keeps life
        interesting!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about learning new technologies, improving my development
        skills, and building apps that make everyday life easier and more
        enjoyable. My goal is to keep growing as a developer while staying
        creative and having fun along the way.
